Test Aug 2018

I am adding text to my readme during our workshop time.  

Best practices are to update this every time I finish work, with the following items:
1) what the project is (this probably won't change)
2) what the goal of the project is (this also probably won't change)
3) next steps (this will probably change, and you want to timestamp things as they get completed)
